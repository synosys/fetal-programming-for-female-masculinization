# Data Visualization and Exploration Portal for Female Masculinization as an Adaptive Trait in Free-Living House Mice

## Description:
An interactive data visualization website developed in collaboration with [Researcherâ€™s Name] to explore key figures and analyses from the long-term ecological study Female Masculinization as an Adaptive Trait in Free-Living House Mice.

This project visualizes 13 years of morphological, hormonal, genetic, and life-history data from a wild house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) population in Switzerland. The dataset includes:

Anogenital distance (AGD) measurements as an index of female masculinization, adjusted for body length and weight.
Hormone profiles (testosterone & corticosterone) from adult hair samples.
Population density and seasonal breeding patterns as measures of reproductive competition.
Parentage, recruitment, and lifetime reproductive success records.

The website allows users to:
Interactively explore trends and correlations across variables.
Compare AGD corrections by body weight vs. body length.
Investigate the relationships between environmental factors, maternal effects, and reproductive outcomes.

## Purpose:
To provide researchers, students, and the public with an accessible, dynamic platform to investigate hypotheses about the adaptive significance of female masculinization under varying ecological and social conditions.

## Tech stack:

R / RStudio for data analysis and visualization (ggplot2, patchwork, viridis, etc.)
JavaScript & D3.js for interactive components
GitHub Pages for hosting
