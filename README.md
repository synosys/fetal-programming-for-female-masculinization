# Data Visualization and Exploration Portal for *Female Masculinization as an Adaptive Trait in Free-Living House Mice*

## Description
An interactive data visualization website developed by Dr. Esther Carlitz and Isin Kosemen to explore key figures and analyses from the long-term ecological study *Female Masculinization as an Adaptive Trait in Free-Living House Mice*.

This project visualizes **13 years** of morphological, hormonal, genetic, and life-history data from a wild house mouse (*Mus musculus domesticus*) population in Switzerland.

### Dataset includes:
- **Anogenital distance (AGD)** measurements as an index of female masculinization, adjusted for body length and weight.  
- **Hormone profiles** (testosterone & corticosterone) from adult hair samples.  
- **Population density** and **seasonal breeding patterns** as measures of reproductive competition.  
- **Parentage**, recruitment, and lifetime reproductive success records.  

### Website features:
- Interactive exploration of trends and correlations across variables.  
- Comparison of AGD corrections by body weight vs. body length.  
- Investigation of relationships between environmental factors, maternal effects, and reproductive outcomes.  

## Purpose
To provide researchers, students, and the public with an accessible, dynamic platform to investigate hypotheses about the adaptive significance of female masculinization under varying ecological and social conditions.

## Tech Stack
- **R / RStudio** for data analysis and visualization (`ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `viridis`, etc.)  
- **JavaScript** & **D3.js** for interactive components  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
